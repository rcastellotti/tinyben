# tinyben

tinyben is an attempt to create a bencharking suite, similar to [phoronix-test-suite](https://www.phoronix-test-suite.com/), but simpler and easier to use. It designed to be <1000 lines of code [1](https://github.com/geohot/minikeyvalue).

We are always supporting (at least) the latest Ubuntu LTS version.

## how to use
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 runner.py 
```
If you need to run with root permission (`apt-get` is part of a benchmark) run instead `sudo venv/bin/python3 runner.py`
